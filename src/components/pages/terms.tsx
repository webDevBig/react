                access and use the services available and described on the
                https://coinxpad.io website (the website and all its
                functionality together being the "Service"), subject to the

            <strong>5. Prohibited Uses</strong>

            <ul>
              <li>
                5.1. PERSONAL USE. The Service is intended solely for the
                User&rsquo;s personal use. The User is only allowed to use the
                Service for personal use, and may not create multiple accounts,
                including for the purpose of collusion and/or abuse of service.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.2 EXPLOITS &amp; BUGS. The Service is provided as is, and any
                exploitation of the Service or errors in program logic and/or
                code (bugs) constitutes a Prohibited Use and a material breach
                of this Agreement. Any funds the user may misappropriate in this
                manner pursuant to this clause shall be considered void and the
                immediate property of Coinxpad.io, without limit.
              </li>
              <li>
                5.3 JURISDICTIONS. Persons located in or residents of the United
                States, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela or any other jurisdiction
                in which it is prohibited from using the Service (the
                &rdquo;Prohibited Jurisdictions&rdquo;) are not permitted to
                make use of the Service. For the avoidance of doubt, the
                foregoing restrictions on Service from Prohibited Jurisdictions
                applies equally to residents and citizens of other nations while
                located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction. Any attempt to circumvent
                the restrictions on usage by any persons located in a Prohibited
                Jurisdiction or Restricted Jurisdiction, is a breach of this
                Agreement. An attempt at circumvention includes, but is not
                limited to, manipulating the information used by Coinxpad to
                identify your location and providing Coinxpad with false or
                misleading information regarding your location or place of
                residence. Any and all monies (including cryptocurrencies) of a
                person located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction on the Service are
                VOID, and can be confiscated or may be returned to the person at
                Coinxpad's sole discretion.

            <p>
              Coinxpad is a permissionless and fully decentralised platform for
              token sales, swaps, and decentralized exchange. As a software
              development company, Coinxpad has no role in enforcing KYC by
              default, however we do provide such tools for fundraising entities
              using Coinxpad to enforce on their users, if the entities choose
              to do so. The use of KYC/AML tools on Coinxpad by fundraising
              entities using the Service is completely at the discretion of said
              entities.

            <p>
              Coinxpad reserves the right, at any time, to ask for any KYC
              documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and
              location of a User. Coinxpad reserves the right to restrict
              service and payment until identity is sufficiently determined.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Coinxpad expressly prohibits and rejects the use of the Service
              for any form of illicit activity, including money laundering,
              terrorist financing or trade sanctions violations, consistent with
              various jurisdictions&rsquo; laws, regulations and norms. To that
              end, the Service is not offered to individuals or entities on any
              Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists, or subject to any United
              States, European Union, or other global sanctions or watch lists.
              By using the Service, end users represent and warrant that they
              are not on any such lists.

                pecuniary loss) arising out of the use (or misuse) of the
                Service even if Coinxpad had prior knowledge of the possibility
